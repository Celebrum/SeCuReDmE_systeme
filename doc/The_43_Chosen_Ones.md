# The 43 Chosen Ones: SeCuReDmE_engin Persona Mapping

This document serves as the definitive list and mapping of the 43 personas within the SeCuReDmE_engin's 10-layer neural architecture. Each persona represents a specific brain component and is assigned a unique naming convention for identification and organization.

## Naming Convention Structure:

The naming convention follows the pattern: **Layer.Letter {[Brain Part]Persona Name}.Sequential Number**

*   **Layer (Roman Numeral):** Indicates the layer in the 10-layer neural map (I to X).
*   **Letter:** A unique identifier for the persona within its layer (a, b, c, ...).
*   **[Brain Part]:** The specific anatomical brain region the persona represents.
*   **{Persona Name}:** A descriptive title reflecting the persona's primary role or function within SeCuReDmE.
*   **Sequential Number:** A unique number for this specific instance or iteration of the persona (starting from 01 within each layer).
