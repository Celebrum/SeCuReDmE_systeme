    "description": "The Sustainer forms the foundational layer upon which all other personas depend. It provides the essential infrastructure for communication and operation. Higher-level commands from personas like The Strategist (Frontal Lobe) would likely be relayed through The Sustainer to reach their intended targets. Similarly, fundamental system status and information would pass through The Sustainer to reach higher levels of processing. If The Sustainer were to falter, the entire system's operation would be severely compromised.",
